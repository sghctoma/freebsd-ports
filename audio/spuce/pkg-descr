A rewrite of the digital filter components of SPUC with more testing, better
code design and c++11 features.

 - Uses std::complex instead of custom complex class
 - Will focus of floating point instead of fixed-point modules
 - Includes Chebyshev2 filter
 - Bug fixes for odd order IIR filters
 - Adding support for Bandpass and Bandstop designs for both IIR and FIR filter

Most of spuc was written many years ago before C++ compilers had good template
support and was primarily written for fixed-point hardware design and
simulation.
