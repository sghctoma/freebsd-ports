The Pothos project is a complete data-flow framework for creating topologies of
interconnected processing blocks. Topologies can be designed and tested
graphically, and deployed over a network. The Pothos framework API is sleek and
smart, enabling users to quickly create custom processing blocks with minimal
boiler-plate. Processing blocks can support compuational offload and integration
with SoC and DMA devices. The project also has a diverse set of processing and
hardware support toolkits.
