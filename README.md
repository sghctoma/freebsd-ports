sghctoma's FreeBSD ports playground
===================================

Some ports for FreeBSD that are mostly usable for my use cases but not quite
ready to PR them.

This port rovides users with the ability to communicate with various Garmin
sport watches and bike computers.

astro/garminplugin
------------------

This browser plugin has the same methods and properties as the official
Garmin Communicator Plugin (http://www8.garmin.com/products/communicator/).
It can be used to transfer GPX files (Geocache Descriptions) to your garmin
device using the official Garmin Javascript API. Its functionality depends on
the device you use.
- Edge305/Forerunner305: ReadFitnessData, ReadGpsData, No write support
- Edge705/Oregon/Dakota: ReadFitnessData, ReadGpsData, Write Gpx files
- Edge800: ReadFitnessData, Write Gpx/Tcx Files
- Other devices: Executes external command to write Gpx to device
